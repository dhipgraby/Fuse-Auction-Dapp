## Fuse Auction Dapp üéÆ

FuseAuction is a decentralized auction platform built on Ethereum that allows users to create auctions for NFTs and bid using either native Fuse or ERC20 tokens. The contract interacts with both NFT and ERC20 contracts to ensure seamless auction creation and bidding.

## Live Dapp version on Vercel - Fuse Sparknet testnet üöÄ
